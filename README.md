Welcome to Surface tools! a collection of tools for surface-based operations

- equivolumetric surfaces: creates equivolumetric surfaces based on the ratio of areas of the mesh surfaces, without the trouble of dealing with volumetric operations. Built together with Alexander Huth at a Brain Hack, a version is also available in Pycortex.
