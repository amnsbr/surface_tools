# Surface tools
Welcome to Surface tools! a collection of tools for surface-based operations

Equivolumetric surfaces: creates equivolumetric surfaces based on the ratio of areas of the mesh surfaces, without the trouble of dealing with volumetric operations.

Built together with Alexander Huth at a Brain Hack, a version is also available in Pycortex.
Casey Paquola and Richard Bethlehem were involved in piloting these scripts on CIVET and FreeSurfer respectively.

To get started you can clone the github repository into your folder of choice:
